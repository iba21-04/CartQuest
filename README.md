Cart Quest 🛒🎮

Tagline: Shop, play, and have fun—what will you eat today?

Cart Quest is a gamified shopping experience where users don’t just pick food—they play a mini-game while exploring different cuisines. From floating pizza slices to glowing taco icons, every interaction is part of the fun!

Game Features ✨

1. Choose Your Cuisine: Indian, Italian, Chinese, or Mexican.
2. Pick Your Dish: Dishes appear dynamically after selecting a cuisine.
3. Gamified Interaction: Floating food icons, glowing buttons, and animated backgrounds make the experience feel alive.
4. Mini-Challenges: Hover and click to interact with food items, unlock animations, and earn points (future enhancement).

How to Play 🎮
